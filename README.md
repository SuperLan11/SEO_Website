The Top Rank SEO project was the final project for the Web Application Development course. 
Partway through the semester, classmates voted between four products to advertise in the site.
The winner was Spray-On Shoes, the fictional product from Cloudy with A Chance of Meatballs.
This was a group project I worked on with two other members. 
Each member's contributions are as follows.
* Kyle Romero: Created home page and its styling
* Landon Johnson: Created shop page, its styling, and its JS
* Sebastian Lopez: Created about page and its styling

The website was created on an EC2 instance using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The website is no longer active, but the source code in this repo lets you use the website as if it was.
The goal of the project was to compete with other groups in our section for the highest ranking website.
Other criteria for the website included a visually pleasing aesthetic, consistent layout, and ease of navigation.
The website used the domain sprayshoestore.com and achieved the following at its peak:
* 1st result with Bing search ”spray shoe store” (1st place result vs local competitors)
* 1st result with Google search ”spray soles store” (1st place result vs local competitors)
* 30th result with Google search “spray shoe store central florida” (1st place result vs local competitors)
* 13th Result with Google search “spray shoe store lakeland” (2nd place result vs local competitors)
* 22nd result with Google search “best spray on shoes near Lakeland, FL” (3rd place result vs local competitors)

To use the website, download the zip file from the green code button, extract the folder, and open the index.html file in the extracted folder.
